        MemeIntent is a new benchmark for intent generation in memes. In the
        paper, we argue that special attention has to be paid to the background
        knowledge required to understand memes, and we propose a new benchmark
        that specifically tests the ability of models to generate intents that
        require such background knowledge. I was involved in discussions about
        the paper content, and I helped with implementing the baseline models
        and experiments. This involved building and testing previous models and
        approaches from the literature to determine that this was in fact a new
        and challenging benchmark.
